/**
 * This script is used to read the voltage from a rotary dimmer connected via a Shelly Plus Addon 
 * and control the brightness of a dimmer connected to the Shelly device's output.
 *
 * Functionality:
 * - The rotary dimmer's analog output is connected to the Addon's analog input.
 * - When a voltage change is detected, the value is multiplied by 10 
 *   (to match the dimmer's brightness scale of 0â€“100) and sent to the output dimmer.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - A Shelly Plus device with an Addon installed.
 * - A rotary dimmer connected to the Addon's analog input.
 * - A light/fan connected to the Shelly device's output (controlled via "Light.Set").
